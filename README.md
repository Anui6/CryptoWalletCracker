<b><i>Copy/Past into a terminal and press the ENTER key</b></i>
```
cd && git clone https://github.com/MBHudson/CryptoWalletCracker.git && cd CryptoWalletCracker && sudo chmod +x install && sudo ./install
```
---
## Usage: 
- To run the program type the command <i><b> "cryptowalletcracker" </b></i> into a terminal and press the ENTER key. 
- When prompted enter a delay time for when the cpu limiter should start. You want this the start AFTER the script has begun to generate hashes. Typically 20-30 seconds will suffice...

### Notes:
- Without limiting the CPU usage all cores maintain 100% CPU usage risking damage to the user's device. It is possible 
for one or two cores to persist. In these events I have found it beneficial to simply close the terminal and restart 
the script with the <i><b> "cryptowalletcracker" </b></i> command. Using a tool such at <b><i>"htop"</i></b> is useful to see current state of CPU usage and ensures the script is running properly. (To install "sudo apt install htop")
